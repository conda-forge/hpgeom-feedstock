  summary: Lightweight implementation of HEALPix geometry functions, wrapped in a numpy interface
  description: |
    HPGeom is a lightweight implementation of HEALPix geometry functions.
    The implementation is based on the geometric functions in the original
    HEALPix C++ library code. This package has an all-new API, and also
    includes compatibility functions with the same interface as healpy for
    an easy transition from healpy to HPGeom.
    an optional C extension for a serious speed boost.
